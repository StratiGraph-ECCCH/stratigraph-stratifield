"""The field assistant SIGNS, and the tablet changes hands without changing author.

Design note *«Il field assistant firma, e ricorda»* §0: **no ingestion without an
author.** The node already refuses to write without an identity — that refusal
lives in `contract.py` and is structural. What was missing was the other half:
a page that stops somebody from dictating into a form whose words could never be
attributed, and a hand-over that actually hands over.

Three properties are worth a test rather than a comment, because each of them
fails SILENTLY:

* a token written to disk outlives the person holding the device, and nothing
  about the page would look different;
* an authorization code left in the address bar is a code in the history and in
  every screenshot, and the sign-in works anyway;
* «esci» that only forgets the token lets the next sign-in walk back in on
  Keycloak's cookie **as the previous person** — the whole trap, and the screen
  looks correct while it happens.

Read from the SOURCE, like `test_pwa_under_a_prefix.py`: these are properties of
the file, and a browser is not needed to see them.
