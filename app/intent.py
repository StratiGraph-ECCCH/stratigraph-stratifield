"""Transcript → intent + slots, with a rule fallback that always works.

Two parsers behind one function, and the order is the design:

1. **rules** — a small, explicit matcher over the intents the registry declares.
   Deterministic, instant, no model, and it is what the tests use. It is also
   what runs when the node has no model loaded, which on a dig is a Tuesday;
2. **the LLM seam** (N5) — the provider-neutral seam already built for the
   narrative AI-authoring: a local model on the Field Computing Node parses the
   sentence the rules could not. Provider-neutral because the node decides what
   it runs, and no call leaves the excavation.

The rules go **first**, not last. A field card's commands are a closed
vocabulary somebody designed on purpose ("crea una nuova scheda"), and asking a
model to interpret a phrase that matches exactly would be slower, less
predictable and occasionally wrong. The model is for the sentences a person
actually says when their hands are dirty.

**The registry is what it chooses from.** Both parsers are given the tools that
EXIST, so neither can route to a capability this node does not have — an
assistant confidently answering with a tool nobody installed is worse than one
saying it cannot.

# ── the model, and the lever that turns it on ────────────────────────────────
#
# The seam above (`IntentModel`) has existed since the MVP and `llm_parse` was
# careful from the start. What was missing was the LEVER: `/health` declared
# `intent_model` as a boolean and nothing could set it. A capability that
# declares itself but cannot be configured is a promise with no switch — the one
# place where E.D.'s rule was not carried through:
#
#   > If the node has an AI you have functions; if it does not, you do not — and
#   > the surface says so.
#
# So this follows `speech.py` gesture for gesture: config-gated, never chosen in
# silence, **a half-configuration refuses with a sentence** instead of falling
# back, and nothing heavy is imported at module load — a node that never uses a
# model must not carry its dependencies.
#
# WHICH PROVIDER. The seam is provider-neutral on purpose (the node decides what
# it runs), and what is implemented here is the one road a Field Computing Node
# can actually walk offline: **an OpenAI-compatible local endpoint**, which covers
# Ollama and llama.cpp — and llamafile, and vLLM — without tying us to any of
# them. Anything else is refused BY NAME, saying what this build cannot do,
# rather than pretending.
#
# AND THERE IS NO DEFAULT ENDPOINT. That is not an omission: a default would be
# somebody's cloud, and design note §5 forbids exactly that — «an excavation's
# audio leaving for a third-party provider because the local model was not there
# is an incident, not a fallback». A model with no endpoint refuses.

#: `<provider>:<model>` — e.g. `openai:llama3.2`. The bare `<model>` is accepted
#: and means `openai:`, because that is the only provider this build speaks and
#: an operator should not have to write a word that has one value.

INTENT_ENDPOINT_VAR = "EM_CHATBOT_INTENT_ENDPOINT"
