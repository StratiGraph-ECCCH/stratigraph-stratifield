// Deliberately the SHELL ONLY: the page and nothing else. Caching the answers
// would mean a field client showing a unit that was never written, which is the
// one lie an assistant like this must not tell. What survives being offline is
// the ability to WORK — the queue in the page holds what was said until the
// node answers again.
//
// THE SHELL NOW INCLUDES THE BRAND, and that is the point of vendoring it. The
// fetch handler below is cache-first, so the theme and the faces would end up
// cached after the first online load anyway — but "after the first online load"
// is exactly the case a trench does not offer. Precached, the assistant opens
// looking like itself on a device that has never had signal.
//
// ~190 KB for eight woff2 and a stylesheet: the price of not depending on a
// network, paid once, on a device that will spend its day without one.
// THE CACHE NAME IS GENERATED, NOT BUMPED BY HAND.
//
// `__SHELL_VERSION__` is substituted by the node when it serves this file (see
// `app/main.py::service_worker`) and is a digest of the shell's actual bytes.
// Hand-bumping a version is a step somebody forgets, and forgetting it means a
// device in a trench keeps serving yesterday's page from cache with no way to
// know — the worst shape of an offline bug, because it looks like it works.
//
// Left as a literal when nothing substitutes it, so opening this file straight
// from disk still gives a working worker.

// the page derives its API base: on the shared https origin, `/brand/...` is not
// this app's `/brand/...`, and a precache list of absolute paths would quietly
// fill the cache with somebody else's files (or with 404s) while looking like it
// worked. Relative entries below resolve against this, which is also exactly the
// worker's scope.

// surface was one file. It stops being honest the moment the front-end has
// parts: every file added is one more thing that can fail to be in the cache,
// and the failure is invisible until somebody is in a trench with no signal.
//
// `__SHELL_FILES__` is substituted by the node with what is actually on disk
// under `web/` (`app/main.py::service_worker`). A font weight added to the
// brand, or a module added to the page, is cached because it is THERE — not
// because somebody remembered to add a line.
//
// The literal below is the fallback for reading this file straight from disk:
// the page and the theme, which is the minimum that makes the app open.
